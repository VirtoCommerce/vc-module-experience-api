## Query GraphQL

```curl
POST https://{platform-url}/graphql
```

It accepts POST requests with following fields in a JSON body:

- `query` - String - GraphQL query as a string
- `variables` - Object - Optional - containing JSON object that defines variables for your query
- `operationName` - String - Optional - the name of the operation, in case you defined several of them in the query
  
Here is an example of a GraphQL query:

```curl
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:10645/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
  -H "Authorization:Bearer ..." \
  -d '{"operationName":null,"variables":{},"query":"{ product(id: \"019e93d973cd4adab99b6f9cbb4ca97a\") { name }}"}'
```

## Full-Text Search

The `query` -  parameter performs the full-text search on the product index document. Expects the full-text search phrase.

### Searchable fields
The search conducts a full-text search over product data in the index. A product search returns all product variations a product has.
We are stored all searchable text data of a product  in one `__content` field in the resulting index document and perform full-text search only for this field.

*product document in the index*
```json
"__content": [
    "JGC-85796278",
    "ASUS ZenFone 2 ZE551ML Gold",
    "asus",
    "android",
    "2.3 ghz intel gtx quad-core",
    "micro-sim",
    "1080"
  ],
```
The following product properties are stored in the `__content` field and are searched by default.

- `product.name`
- `product.code`
- `product.seoinfos.seoinfo.slug`
- `product.properties.value`
- `product.variations.code`
- `product.variations.properties.value`

Example requests:

```GraphQL
# Search all products by keyword `sony` and return the  name and primary image url for first 20 found products and total count
{
  products(query: "sony" first:20) {
      totalCount
      items
      {
        name    
        imgSrc
      }
  }
}
```
## Fuzzy Search

When the `fuzzy` query parameter is set to true the search will also return [product]() that contain slight differences to the search text.
For example, when someone searches for ‘unversty’, the fuzzy search would also return products labelled with ‘university’.
The fuzzy level can be optionally set with the parameter `fuzzyLevel`, otherwise the will be used auto fuzzy level based on the length of the searched text. Min value 3, max value 6.

Example requests:

```GraphQL
# Will return products that have such terms "university", "unversty", "universe" etc.
{
  products(query: "unversty" first:20) {
      totalCount
      items
      {
        name    
        imgSrc
      }
  }
}
```

## Filters

Search results can optionally be filtered and these filters are applied to the search hits **at the very end of a search request**, after all facets  have already been calculated and don’t influence facet counts any more.

```GraphQL
# The following example search request filters products of a certain color “Black” OR "Blue" AND price between 100 USD inclusive TO 200 USD exlusive AND name starts with "ASUS ZenFone 2"
{
  products(filter: "color:Black,Blue price.usd:[100 TO 200) name:\"ASUS ZenFone 2*\" {
      totalCount
      items
      {
        name   
        properties
        {
            name
            values
        } 
      }
  }
}
```
### Terms
A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of terms: `Single Terms` and `Phrases`.
A `Single Term` is a single word such as "test" or "hello".
A `Phrase` is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as "hello dolly".
Multiple terms can be combined together with Boolean operators to form a more complex query (see below).

### Fields
 When performing a search you can either specify a field by typing the field name followed by a colon ":" and then the term you are looking for.

 `name:"My cool name"  color:Black`

Specifying multiple values in one field parameter, separated by a comma, will return products in which at least one of the specified values matches (OR-operator).
The example search request below filters products of the color “black” OR “grey” or "blue":

 `color:Black,Gey,Blue`

### Range Filtration

Range filtration allow one to match products whose field(s) values are between the lower and upper bound specified by the Range expression. Range filter expression can be inclusive or exclusive of the upper and lower bounds. Sorting is done lexicographically.

`price:[100 TO 200]`

This will find products whose prices have values between 100 and 200, inclusive. 
Inclusive range queries are denoted by square brackets. Exclusive range queries are denoted by round brackets.

`price:(100 TO 200]`
This will find products whose prices have values between 100 exclusive and 200 inclusive. 

You can skip one of the values to ignore either the lower or the upper bound

`price:(TO 100]`
where the price is less than or equal to 100

### Boolean Operators

Passing multiple field terms in the one filter expression separated by space delimiter will combine them with an AND operator.

The following example search request filters products of a certain brand "Onkyo" AND of the color “Black”.
`color:Black brand:Onkyo`

> At the moment  only AND logical operator is supported for filter expressions. 

### Wildcard Searches
You can use single and multiple character wildcard searches within single or phrase terms.
To perform a single character wildcard search use the `?` symbol.
To perform a multiple character wildcard search use the `*` symbol.

`te?t`
Multiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters.

For example, to search for test, tests or tester, you can use the search:
`test*`

You can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term.
`te*t`

### Escaping Special Characters
Inside the double quotes block you might use any unsafe characters, to escape double quote character use the `\`. See more details [GraphQL String-Value](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-String-Value)
  
`\"my cool property\":\"&~!'\"`

### More examples
`color:Black,White`
where the color is 'Black' OR 'White'

`color:Black color:White`
where the color is 'Black' AND 'White'

`price_usd:[100 TO 200]`
where the price is in USD and between values including bounds

`price:(100 TO 200)`
where the price is in any currency and between values excluding bounds

`price:(0 TO)`
where the price is greater than zero

`price:(TO 100]`
where the price is less than or equal to 100

`Da?? Red*`
use ? to replace a single character, and * to replace zero or more characters

`color:Black price:[100 TO 200)`
combine keywords and filters
