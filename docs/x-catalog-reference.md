## Syntax
### Full-Text Search
The `query` -  parameter performs the full-text search on the product index document. Expects the full-text search phrase.

#### Searchable fields
The search conducts a full-text search over product data in the index. A product search returns all product variations a product has.
We are stored all searchable text data of a product  in one `__content` field in the resulting index document and perform full-text search only for this field.

*product document in the index*
```json
"__content": [
    "JGC-85796278",
    "ASUS ZenFone 2 ZE551ML Gold",
    "asus",
    "android",
    "2.3 ghz intel gtx quad-core",
    "micro-sim",
    "1080"
  ],
```
The following product properties are stored in the `__content` field and are searched by default.

- `product.name`
- `product.code`
- `product.seoinfos.seoinfo.slug`
- `product.properties.value`
- `product.variations.code`
- `product.variations.properties.value`

Example requests:

```GraphQL
# Search all products by keyword `sony` and return the  name and primary image url for first 20 found products and total count
{
  products(query: "sony" first:20) {
      totalCount
      items
      {
        name
        imgSrc
      }
  }
}
```
### Fuzzy Search

When the `fuzzy` query parameter is set to true the search will also return [product]() that contain slight differences to the search text.
For example, when someone searches for ‘unversty’, the fuzzy search would also return products labelled with ‘university’.
The fuzzy level can be optionally set with the parameter `fuzzyLevel`, otherwise the will be used auto fuzzy level based on the length of the searched text. Min value 3, max value 6.

Example requests:

```GraphQL
# Will return products that have such terms "university", "unversty", "universe" etc.
{
  products(query: "unversty" first:20) {
      totalCount
      items
      {
        name
        imgSrc
      }
  }
}
```

### Filter by category
Filter products that belong to exactly specified category path.
`filter: "category.path:{catalog id/category path}"`

`filter: "category.path:catalogId/cat1d1/cat2id"`

> The search will be performed on `__path` index field of product document

Filter by category subtrees, keep only the products that belong to the specified Category or any of its descendant categories.
`filter: "category.subtree:{catalog id/category path}"`

`filter: "category.subtree:catalogId/cat1d1/cat2id"`

> The search will be performed on `__outline` index field of product document


### Filter by price
Keep only the products which Price match the specified value or [range]()

`filter: "price.{currency}.{pricelist?}:{range expression}"`

`filter: "price.usd:(TO 100]"`

`filter: "price.usd.pricelist_1:(20 TO 100]"`

Keep only products that  with at least one price set

`filter: "is:priced`

> The search will be performed on `price_{currency}` and `price_{currency}_{pricelist}` index fields of product document
> Please note, that only the indexed prices were used for filtration. Scoped prices based on user groups or dynamic expressions temporary do not support filtration.

### Filter by SKU
Keep only the product which matches the specified SKU:
`filter: "sku:DLL-65789352`

### Filter products or variations
Keep only the products or variations in result. If not set will return both types.

`filter: "is:product`

`filter: "is:variation`

### Filter by custom properties
Keep only the products or variation with the custom attribute matching the specified value or range.

`filter: "properties.{property name}: {value}`

`filter: "properties.color:red`

To use property name contains spaces need to use the following syntax with escaped double quotes
`filter= "\"processor core (ghz)\":\"1.8 GHz Intel GTX Quad-Core\""`

For numeric and date time properties you might use range filter

`filter: "length:(10 TO 20)"`

`filter: "publishDate:(TO \"2020-01-28\")"`

> All product custom properties are stored in the index as fields with the same names as properties have.  `{property.name}:{property.value}`

### Filter by product availability
Keep only the products or variations with the availability matching the specified value or range.

`filter: "available_in:{warehouse}"`

`filter: "available_in:my-warehouse"`


### Muti-select faceting search
The policy let select multiple values of the same facet (e.g using checkbox).
You can read more for how the muti-select faceting search work on this great article [How to implement multi-select faceting for nested documents in Solr](https://blog.griddynamics.com/multi-select-faceting-for-nested-documents-in-solr/) and [Elastic search post filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/search-request-body.html#request-body-search-post-filter)

The muti-select faceting search policy is enabled by default and you do not need any extra parameters or setting to activate it.

### Sorting
By default, search results are sorted descending by their relevancy with respect to the provided text (that is their “score”). An alternative sorting can be specified  via the sort query parameter which has the structure `{field}:{asc|desc}` you can combine multiple sort expression  by semicolon  `;`

`sort: "priority:desc;price.usd;score"`

### Facets
Faceted search (sometimes also called faceted navigation) allows users to navigate through a web site by applying filters for categories, attributes, price ranges and so on. The main idea behind faceted search is to present the attributes of the documents of the previous search result as filters, which can be used by the user to narrow down search results along with calculate statistical counts to aid.

Facet calculation is requested by providing facet expression via the facet query parameter. Consider for example the following two facets:

`facet: "color price:[TO 100),[100 TO 200])"`

The resulting json would be like seen here:

```json
"data": {
    "products": {
      "totalCount": 182,
      "items": [...],
      "range_facets": [
        {
          "name": "price_*-100_100-200",
          "ranges": [
            {
              "from": 0,
              "to": 100,
              "count": 5959,
              "includeTo": false,
              "includeFrom": true
            },
            {
              "from": 100,
              "to": 200,
              "count": 2143,
              "includeTo": true,
              "includeFrom": true
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "term_facets": [
        {
          "name": "color",
          "terms": [
            {
              "term": "EXPRESSO",
              "count": 2343
            },
            {
              "term": "Sierra Brown",
              "count": 362
            },
            ...
        }]
    }
}
```

### TermFacet expression
To retrieve facet counts for all occurring values of a product document field the following notations can be applied:

`facet: "category.path"`
Counts the products of all categories.

`facet: "{propertyName}"`
`facet: "properties.{propertyName}"`
Counts the product documents for all occurring values of custom  properties.

### TermFacet result
The term type facets provide the counts for each of the different values the query parameter happens to have.
`name` - represents the key of requested facet taken from facet expression.
`terms.term` - one of the values for the field specified in facet expression for which at least one product could be found
`terms.count` - amount of products  for which the term applies
`terms.isSelected` - flag indicates that requested facet term is used in `filter` expression, in order to simplify displaying the already selected facet terms on the frontend.

### RangeFacet expression
To aggregate facet counts across ranges of values, the range qualifier can be applied analogous to the filter parameters. The `range` notation is applicable to the date, time, datetime, number and money type fields.

`facet: "price.{currency}:[TO 100),[100 TO 200])"`
Counts the products whose price falls in one of the specified ranges

`facet: "properties.{propertyName}[1 TO 100)"`
Counts the products whose values of the custom property fall in one of the specified ranges

### RangeFacet result
The range facet type counts the products for which the query value is a range specified in the range expression. Range facets are typically used to determine the minimum and maximum value for example product prices to filter products by price with a range slider.

`name` - represents the key of requested facet taken from facet expression and build from range parameters concatenated by `_`. e.g `price_*-100_100-200`
`ranges.from` - the range’s lower endpoint in number format
`ranges.to` - the range’s upper endpoint in string format
`ranges.count` - amount of products fall into the specified range
`ranges.includeTo` - flag indicates that lower bound is included
`ranges.includeFrom` - flag indicates that upper bound is included
`ranges.isSelected` - flag indicates that requested facet term is used in `filter` expression, in order to simplify displaying the already selected facet terms on the frontend.
